      <p class="text">
        Because of pollution, the Earth's ozone layer has suffered a lot. That's
        bad news for everyone, since the fragile gas layer protects our planet
        and shields us from the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays. Fortunately,
        climate change experts believe that the ozone layer will fully heal
        within 50 years, according to a 2018 report from the United Nations. The
        recovery is thanks in large part to the Montreal Protocol of 1987, which
        put a global ban on the use of one of the main culprits for the damage:
        chlorofluorocarbons (CFOs). Previously, CFOs had been common in
        refrigerators, aerosol cans, and dry-cleaning chemicals.
